# Intersecting_Burdens
This project examines the relationship between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty across countries from 2000 to 2023. By merging World Health Organization HIV data with World Bank indicators of poverty—including education, income, sanitation, and electricity access—a mixed-effects model is used to analyze how structural inequalities influence the HIV burden.
